# Decisions

Decision log for Kubushka. Add new entries at the bottom; never rewrite history — supersede instead.

## D1 — Tech stack: use `package.json` as-is (2026-07-27)

React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind 4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), react-router 7, TanStack Query 5, zustand 5, react-hook-form 7 + zod 4, recharts 3, Radix (`radix-ui` umbrella package), CVA + tailwind-merge, sonner, react-day-picker 9, lucide-react, React Compiler babel plugin. Fonts via `@fontsource/space-grotesk` + `@fontsource/spline-sans-mono`.

The stack was fixed by the handoff `package.json`; no substitutions. Note: README §3 mentions `socket.io-client` being in deps — it is **not** actually present in `package.json`, so there is nothing to omit.

## D2 — Persistence: Dexie.js on IndexedDB (2026-07-27)

**Chosen by the user** over (a) localStorage JSON and (b) a hand-rolled IndexedDB wrapper.

- Dependency added: `dexie@^4.4.4` (the one deliberate deviation from "package.json as-is").
- Database name `kubushka`, one table per entity (`assets`, `snapshots`, `transactions`), schema pinned in `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md` Task 2.
- All access goes through `src/lib/repository.ts`; components never import `db` directly. UI consumes the repository via TanStack Query hooks.
- Settings (currency preference) and draft quote entry are **not** in Dexie — they live in persisted zustand stores (localStorage), per README §3.

## D3 — Personal pet project: no Jira (2026-07-27)

This is the user's personal pet project. **Never ask for a Jira key.** Git conventions:

- Base branch: `dev` (the initial commit lives there; feature branches start from and merge back to it).
- Branches: `<type>/<short-kebab-title>`, e.g. `feat/daily-quotes` — no ticket keys.
- Commits: plain conventional commits `<type>: <summary>` — no ticket keys, no AI-attribution trailers/footers.

## D4 — Testing: vitest for pure logic only (2026-07-27)

Add `vitest` as a devDependency in Task 2 (first task that produces pure logic). Unit-test the derivation/formatting layer (`src/lib/derive.ts`, `src/lib/format.ts`) against the known seed figures from README §7 — these are real portfolio numbers with published expected outputs (+4.41%, +₴4,452.61, $3,324.03 …), which make exact-value fixtures. UI is verified in the browser against the design reference plus the README §9 behavior checklist; no component/E2E test harness unless a future need appears.

## D5 — Reference-data reconciliation (2026-07-27)

An adversarial review (3 agents cross-checking README, the design HTML and the plan) proved the reference's mock data is **internally inconsistent**. These resolutions are pinned; do not "fix" the resulting mismatches back:

1. **Headline figures use latest-quote-per-asset, not the latest complete snapshot.** The 27.07 snapshot is PARTIAL (only REIT 68 702,10; others "pending"). Sidebar/Overview/donut/Portfolio show ₴149,016.36 = REIT's 27.07 quote + the other three from 25.07 + cash — README §7's "latest complete snapshot" wording (→ ₴148,943.62) contradicts the reference's own numbers and is superseded by `latestQuotes`/`headlineTotal`. Net result +₴4,452.61 excludes cash.
2. **Snapshot seed = exactly 174:** daily 03.02→25.07 complete (173, **no 26.07** — the reference table jumps 25.07→27.07) + the partial 27.07 row.
3. **Income: README §7 aggregates win** (div 3 641,44 + coupons 1 399,50 = 5 040,94; reinvested 1 387,38 = REIT 1 171,38 + …6475 216,00, "27.5% of income"). The design's payout log sums ₴176,00 higher (div 3 817,44) and its reinvest destinations sum 1 583,57 — both irreconcilable with the KPI cards. Seed adjustment: the 648,13 dividend dated 12.05 becomes **472,13 dated 10.05**; reinvest txs are **687,02 + 484,36 (REIT), 216,00 (…6475)**. Accepted visible deviations from the reference: one log row, the May bar label, Seasonality day-10 label ₴3,641 (reference ₴3,817), one "reinvested (₴…)" destination string.
4. **Rebalance uses two formulas:** trim = (share−target)%×total (matches reference −₴9,095); top-up = (target%×total − value)/(1 − target%) ≈ ₴11,429 (reference prints ₴11,413 — mock rounding; we display the derived value).
5. **Annualized daysHeld basis is the global portfolio start 03.02.2026 for every asset** (design footnote; per-asset firstPurchase would give …6475 +34.5% instead of the reference's +10.9%).
6. **Deposited KPI (₴143,176)** is derived from seeded `deposit` transactions totaling 143 176,37 (= own-funded buys 143 168,62 + cash 7,75).
7. **Expected/upcoming payouts:** bonds from `couponAmount` + `nextCoupon`/`maturity` attributes; dividend assets estimated as their latest dividend with a "~" prefix (reference's "~₴715" vs derived ~₴700 — accepted mock imprecision).
